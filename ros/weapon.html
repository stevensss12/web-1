	<h1><u>Tier 1 Weapons</u></h1>


	<h2>Assault Rifle - M14EBR</h2>
	<p>The <b>M14EBR</b> is the perfect blend between sniper rifle and assault rifle. It's accurate and fires faster than all snipers but still has 40 rounds to go through, so it can easily double up as a mid-range weapon too.</p>

	<h2>Assault Rifle - M249</h2>
	<p>If you like getting up close and personal, the <b>M249</b> is the weapon for you. It's only found in supply crates so it's quite hard to get hold of, but it's well worth the effort. This weapon has 100 rounds per magazine and can shred through players quickly, especially at close range.</p>

	<h2>Sniper - Barrett</h2>
	<p>The <b>Barrett</b> is the best sniper in the game. It one-hit kills all players and can only be found in supply crates. If you see this weapon, it's always worth going for. Our only complaint is that it's hard to come by.</p>

	<h2>Sniper - AS VAL</h2>
	<p>Whilst in the sniper class, the AS VAL is better considered as a weapon for medium distance engagements. It has a fast fire rate and a 20 round mag. It is also exclusive to supply crates.</p>

	<h1><u>Tier 2 Weapons</u></h1>

	<h2>Assault Rifle - AR15</h2>
	<p>The <b>AR15</b> is a very stable assault rifle that can take a lot of attachments. If you're lucky to find the right gear, you can turn this into a long ranged AR-sniper hybrid. Unfortunately, the damage is low in comparison to other assault rifles.</p>



	<h2>Assault Rifle - M4A1</h2>
	<p>The <b>M4A1</b> is essentially the middle ground for assault rifles. It has a moderate stability and a moderate damage rating. It has a number of unique attachments that make it a potential beast if you can find the right equipment.</p>


	<h2>Shotgun - AA12</h2>
	<p>The <b>AA12</b> is a fully auto shotgun that can shred through players at close range. It's a great weapon for players that struggle to aim, but later in the game it loses its value.</p>
	
	<h2>Sniper - AWM</h2>
	<p>The <b>AWM</b> is a rare loot item found outside of supply boxes. Unfortunately, the AWM damage is very poor. The long range makes it a worthwhile choice despite the low damage.</p>

	<h2>Sniper - SVD</h2>
	<p>The <b>SVD</b> is essentially the same story as the AWM – it’s another sniper that can be found in buildings. It does low damage for a sniper but the long range make it a better choice than most other weapons.</p>

	<h2>SMG - Thompson</h2>
	<p>Most SMGS aren't worth picking up, but the <b>Thompson</b> insane fire rate makes it formidable at close range. At long range, the Thompson is once again useless.</p>


	<h1><u>Tier 3 Weapons</u></h1>

	<h2>Assault Rifle - AKM</h2>
	<p>Out of all assault rifles, the <b>AKM</b> deals the most damage. The trouble is, the AKM stability is terrible. Trying to aim this thing is almost impossible, which makes it a terrible choice, especially at range.</p>

	<h2>Shotgun - M870</h2>
	<p>The <b>M870</b> is slow-firing and is only useful in close quarters. It's not worth picking up when the slow fire rate can be unforgiving and the limited range makes it useless later in the game.</p>

	<h2>Pistol - Desert Eagle</h2>
	<p>Both pistols in Rules Of Survival aren't worth using unless you don't have another weapon, but the <b>Desert Eagle</b> does more damage than the G18C so it's worth picking up over the G18C.</p>

	<h1><u>Tier 4 Weapons</u></h1>

	<h2>Shotgun - Model 1887</h2>
	<p>There's nothing about this <b>shotgun M1887</b> that makes it a viable option unless you're point blank in another player's face and are good at aiming. This weapon has only two shots per reload and it's incredibly slow firing. If you're not close enough, you may not even be able to kill somebody even if you hit both shots</p>

	<h2>Pistol - G18C</h2>
	<p>The only reason you should pick this up is if it's the first weapon you find. The damage is very low and at long range it's very hard to use. The only positive to the <b>G18C</b> is that it has a very fast fire rate.</p>

	<h2>SMG - PP19</h2>
	<p>Terrible stability, low range and very little damage make the <b>PP19</b> one of the worst weapons in the game.</p>
